## Goal
In this repository I'm going to explore ocerisation technologies via python, java and C#.

# Python
EasyOCR is a Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It supports over 80 languages and is particularly effective for recognizing text in images, including handwritten text and complex fonts. EasyOCR leverages deep learning models for high accuracy and can be quickly integrated into Python projects for text extraction from images or PDFs.

# CSharp
IronOCR is a commercial OCR library for .NET, offering high accuracy and performance in text recognition from images and PDFs. It supports various languages and file formats, including PDFs, and is known for handling noisy or complex images better than many other OCR tools.\n
Tesseract, on the other hand, is an open-source OCR engine widely used in many languages, including C#. It supports over 100 languages and is highly customizable, though it may require more setup and image preprocessing for optimal results, especially in low-quality images.

# Java
Tess4J is a Java wrapper for the open-source OCR engine Tesseract, enabling developers to easily integrate text recognition capabilities into Java applications. It supports over 100 languages and can extract text from images in various formats such as PNG, JPG, and TIFF. Tess4J provides a simple API for performing OCR tasks, making it a popular choice for text extraction from scanned documents and images.
